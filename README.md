# Neural Network and Deep Learning Class Project

This repository contains my class project for the **Neural Network and Deep Learning** course. The project was implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook.

## Projects

Throughout the course, I worked on several key projects, including:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Implemented and trained CNN models for various tasks.
- **Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNNs)**: Developed RCNN models for object detection tasks.
- **Transformers**: Worked on transformer models for sequence-based tasks.
- **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**: Built VAEs for generative modeling tasks.

## Side Projects

In addition to the main projects, I also worked on several side projects that enhanced my understanding of deep learning concepts.
