# Neural Network and Deep Learning Class Project

This repository contains my class project for the Neural Network and Deep Learning course. The project was implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook. It focuses on building and training a neural network on the MNIST dataset and experimenting with adversarial attacks (FGSM and PGD).
