# Neural Network and Deep Learning Class Project

## Overview
This repository contains my class project for the Neural Network and Deep Learning course. The project was implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook. It focuses on building and training a neural network on the MNIST dataset and experimenting with adversarial attacks (FGSM and PGD).
